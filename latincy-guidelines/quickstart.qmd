# Annotation Quickstart {.unnumbered}

This page is a quick reference for the LatinCy annotation review process. Detailed guidelines for each topic are in preparation and will be published as additional chapters.

## Your Task

You are reviewing **model output** — the LatinCy pipeline has already analyzed each text, and your job is to check and correct its predictions. Each passage is presented in a spreadsheet with the following columns:

| Column | What it contains | Your action |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **token** | The word as it appears in the text | Read-only |
| **lemma** | Dictionary headword | Check and correct if needed |
| **upos** | Part-of-speech tag | Check and correct if needed |
| **feats** | Morphological features | Check and correct if needed |
| **deprel** | Dependency relation | Check ROOT and nsubj only (for now) |
| **ent_type** | Named entity type | Check PERSON, LOC, NORP |

It will take time to get used to reading the Latin in this word-by-word fashion, but after a few sentences you should begin to develop some strategies and notice patterns.

## Lemma

The **lemma** is the dictionary headword. It should match whatever appears in the passage vocabulary.

**Quick rules:**

- **Nouns**: nominative singular — *homo*, *civitas*, *rex*
- **Adjectives**: nominative singular masculine — *bonus*, *omnis*, *felix*
- **Verbs**: first person singular present indicative — *amo*, *sum*, *fero*, *dico*
- **Pronouns**: citation form varies — *qui*, *sui*, *ego*, *hic*
- **Prepositions**: fuller form — *ab* (not *a*), *ex* (not *e*)

::: {.callout-tip}
## Common errors to watch for
- Adjectives lemmatized as neuter (*omne*) or plural (*omnes*) instead of masculine singular (*omnis*)
- Deponent verbs lemmatized as active
- Prepositions shortened (*a* instead of *ab*)
:::

*Full lemmatization guidelines forthcoming.*

## UPOS (Part of Speech) {#sec-quickstart-upos}

The UPOS column contains one of the following 17 tags:

| Tag | Description | Examples |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| **ADJ** | Adjective | *bonus*, *omnis*, *magnus* |
| **ADP** | Adposition (preposition) | *in*, *ad*, *de*, *cum*, *per* |
| **ADV** | Adverb | *non*, *iam*, *semper*, *bene* |
| **AUX** | Auxiliary verb (for our purposes, just *sum*) | *est*, *sunt*, *erat* |
| **CCONJ** | Coordinating conjunction | *et*, *sed*, *atque*, *vel* |
| **DET** | Determiner | *hic*, *ille*, *iste*, *omnis* (when modifying a noun) |
| **INTJ** | Interjection | *o*, *ecce*, *eheu* |
| **NOUN** | Noun | *vir*, *urbs*, *virtus*, *bellum* |
| **NUM** | Numeral | *unus*, *duo*, *tres*, *centum* |
| **PART** | Particle | *autem*, *enim*, *igitur*, *quidem* |
| **PRON** | Pronoun | *qui*, *ego*, *se*, *quis* |
| **PROPN** | Proper noun | *Caesar*, *Roma*, *Gallia* |
| **PUNCT** | Punctuation | `.` `,` `;` `:` |
| **SCONJ** | Subordinating conjunction | *ut*, *cum*, *si*, *quod*, *quia* |
| **SYM** | Symbol | `†` (crux in charters), `%` |
| **VERB** | Verb (including infinitives and participles) | *dicit*, *fecit*, *dicere*, *dictus* |
| **X** | Other (foreign words, typos) | *χαῖρε* |

::: {.callout-note}
## Key distinctions
- **PART vs. CCONJ**: Discourse particles like *autem*, *enim*, *igitur* are PART (not CCONJ). Coordinating conjunctions join clauses or phrases: *et*, *sed*, *atque*.
- **NOUN vs. PROPN**: Common nouns (*rex*, *consul*) are NOUN. Specific names (*Caesar*, *Roma*) are PROPN.

## Morphological Features {#sec-quickstart-feats}

The **feats** column contains morphological features separated by `|`. The model predicts these; you should verify the key features for each word class.

### Nouns, Adjectives, Pronouns, Determiners

These should have **Gender**, **Number**, and **Case**:

| Feature | Values |
|---------|--------|
| Gender | `Fem`, `Masc`, `Neut` |
| Number | `Sing`, `Plur` |
| Case | `Nom`, `Gen`, `Dat`, `Acc`, `Abl`, `Voc` (also `Loc` rarely) |

**Example:** *virtutis* → `Case=Gen|Gender=Fem|Number=Sing`

### Verbs

These should have **Person**, **Number**, **Tense**, **Aspect**, **Mood**, **Voice**, and **VerbForm**:

| Feature | Values |
|---------|--------|
| Person | `1`, `2`, `3` |
| Number | `Sing`, `Plur` |
| Tense | `Pres`, `Past`, `Fut`, `Pqp` (pluperfect) |
| Aspect | `Perf` (perfective), `Imp` (imperfective) |
| Mood | `Ind`, `Sub` (subjunctive), `Imp` (imperative) |
| Voice | `Act`, `Pass` |
| VerbForm | `Fin` (finite), `Inf` (infinitive), `Part` (participle), `Ger` (gerund), `Gdv` (gerundive), `Sup` (supine) |

**Example:** *scripsit* → `Aspect=Perf|Mood=Ind|Number=Sing|Person=3|Tense=Past|VerbForm=Fin|Voice=Act`

::: {.callout-note}
## Tense and Aspect
UD uses `Tense=Past` for all past tenses. The **Aspect** feature distinguishes them:

- *scripsit* (perfect): `Tense=Past|Aspect=Perf`
- *scribebat* (imperfect): `Tense=Past|Aspect=Imp`
- *scripserat* (pluperfect): `Tense=Pqp|Aspect=Perf`
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## What to check
Focus on the features most likely to be wrong:

- **Case**: The model sometimes confuses nominative/accusative for neuter nouns, or nominative/vocative
- **Tense/Aspect**: Past perfective (*scripsit*) vs. past imperfective (*scribebat*)
- **Mood**: Indicative vs. subjunctive
- **Voice**: Active vs. passive, especially for deponent verbs

## Dependency Relations {#sec-quickstart-deprel}

For now, you only need to check two dependency labels:

### ROOT

The **main verb** of each sentence should be labeled `ROOT`. Every sentence has exactly one ROOT.

```
Poeta        carmen       scripsit.
nsubj        obj          ROOT
"The poet    a poem       wrote."
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Copular sentences
In copular sentences, the **predicate** (not *sum*) is the ROOT:

```
Cicero       consul       est.
nsubj        ROOT         cop
"Cicero      consul       is."
```

Here *consul* is the ROOT because it is the predicate nominal. *est* is labeled `cop` (copula).
:::

### nsubj

The **subject** of the main verb should be labeled `nsubj` (nominal subject). Look for the nominative noun or pronoun that performs the action.

```
Rex          exercitum    duxit.
nsubj        obj          ROOT
"The king    the army     led."
```

Not every sentence has an explicit subject — Latin often drops the pronoun ("pro-drop"):

```
Venit.
ROOT
"(He/she) came."
```

*Full dependency parsing guidelines forthcoming.*

## Named Entity Types {#sec-quickstart-ner}

Check whether names referring to specific people, places, or groups are correctly labeled with one of three entity types:

### PERSON

Named individuals, deities, and specific mythological groups.

| Tag | Not tagged |
|-----|-----------|
| *Caesar* (PERSON) | *consul* (title, not a name) |
| *Venus* (PERSON) | *dea* (common noun) |
| *Ceres* (PERSON) | *Cerealia* (derived adjective) |
| *Musae* (PERSON) | *deae* (common noun) |

### LOC

Locations — cities, regions, rivers, mountains, any named place.

| Tag | Not tagged |
|-----|-----------|
| *Roma* (LOC) | *urbs* (common noun) |
| *Tiberis* (LOC) | *flumen* (common noun) |
| *Alpes* (LOC) | *montes* (common noun) |

### NORP

**N**ationalities **o**r **r**eligious or **p**olitical groups. This includes both noun and adjective forms.

| Tag | Not tagged |
|-----|-----------|
| *Romani* (NORP) | *cives* (common noun) |
| *Troianus* (NORP, adjective form) | *milites* (common noun) |
| *Christiani* (NORP) | *sacerdotes* (common noun) |

::: {.callout-note}
## NORP is used somewhat anachronistically
In the modern NLP context it stands for "Nationalities or religious or political groups." We apply it to ancient groups of people by analogy.

## Quick Checklist

When reviewing a passage:

1. Read through the Latin text to understand the passage
2. Scan the **lemma** column — do headwords match what you see in the vocabulary?
3. Scan the **upos** column — are content words (NOUN, VERB, ADJ) labeled correctly?
4. Scan the **feats** column — for nouns/adjectives, check gender/number/case; for verbs, check person/number/tense/aspect/mood/voice
5. Find the **ROOT** — is the main verb labeled ROOT?
6. Find the **nsubj** — is the subject of that verb labeled nsubj?
7. Scan for **names** — are people, places, and groups labeled PERSON, LOC, or NORP?
8. Correct errors in the designated cells only
